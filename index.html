  <h2>The Seed</h2>
  <p>When I sat down on a warm summer's evening in Staffordshire I had no idea that it would lead to a trilogy of stories being created. The true seed for the project was a set of photos of a day out uploaded to Facebook by a childhood friend. Arley Arboretum, Shropshire. Not my local arboretum because God or erosion has chosen to put the River Severn in the way. They do, however, have Cedar of Lebanon, a tree held in significant reverence in Middle Eastern cultures and the kind of tree that many people before had written stories about.</p>
  <p>At the time, I had been watching a number of Thomas Hardy interpretations across Netflix and Amazon Prime video. I wondered how I'd go about writing a Thomas Hardy style novel and the tree was playing on my mind.</p>

</div>

<div class="w3-padding w3-white w3-display-container">

  <h2>The Seedling</h2>
  <p>With a desire to write like Thomas Hardy and never having picked up a single one of his books there was only one logical place to start. ChatGPT. </p>
   
   
    <div class="w3-container w3-center">
      <img class="w3-image w3-border w3-border-light-grey" src="img/chatgpt-prompt1.png" alt="Beneath"  style="width:50%;"/>
    </div>
  <p>The first book, Beneath the Cedars of Lebanon, was written over the course of an evening and a few hours on one single weekend. 21 chapters. Generated via prompts, copied, pasted to Google Docs on my Poco X3 Pro phone, edited down to correct issues with the story, narrative, continuity, character names and obvious errors before moving onto the next chapter. The very annoying "That completes chapter...would you like me to..." paragraphs were ceremoneously deleted. The American spellings were resolved. The story took shape very quickly. Most of the story came to me as we went along, and it was my prompts that laid out what would happen in each chapter. Occasionally I paused to ask ChatGPT for some ideas, quite often I ignored them, sometimes I took them on. Occasionally I gave ChatGPT creative license explicitly. Mostly I asked ChatGPT to add filler in the style we'd set out because chapters tended to come out at around 600 words. Within a couple of days the first book was written.</p>

<div class="w3-padding w3-white w3-display-container">

  <h2>Primary Growth</h2>
  <p>Once the book was complete the whole thing went through a number of edits to try to make it read a little better. Repetition between chapters was a huge issue. Another issue was overall continuity. Late in the book I'd found a couple of hooks to bring the story to what I felt was a nice conclusion. A few of the hooks I picked upon were contradicted somewhat by sections earlier in the book so those had to be rewritten almost entirely. Without subscription there are limitations on how much you can use the latest ChatGPT model and older models produce varying results, often writing at a slightly poorer standard. It was necessary occasionally to leave gaps of a few hours without touching ChatGPT to let it cool off and allow me back onto the latest model.</p>
  <p>As soon as I was reasonably happy I set about generating my first EPUB version of the book. I found it quite difficult to achieve this from a Google Doc on the phone so ended up flipping to Microsoft Word on the laptop and trying from there. This introduced a whole set of new problems, correcting paragraph spacing, adding a title page, contents, sorting page breaks, etc. Once I had a version I was happy with I tried to save it as an EPUB via MS Word, which I had assumed would not be an issue. As it was I ended up using one of many online services to do the conversion and emailed a copy to my Amazon Kindle account. The first draft of the first book was complete and I gave it to my daughter to read, she didn't read it. I then gave it to my wife to read, she didn't because she halfway through a Jessica Redland novel which she was far more interested in.</p>

</div>

<div class="w3-padding w3-white w3-display-container">

  <h2>Forestry</h2>
  <p>I was in the zone and determined to write a sequel, so I did. On the same ChatGPT thread in fact. I did try to do it on a separate thread but it was almost impossible to summarise the characters and the story as well as the style. At least on the main thread ChatGPT had half a chance of remembering what we'd done so far. The second book was written over a couple of evenings and the third took a little longer, say around 8 to 10 hours in total to write.</p>
  <p>I'll admit to pausing between the fisrt and second book to ask ChatGPT to review it as if it were a reviewer on New York Times. The issue with doing this is that ChatGPT is literally programmed to please you, and that's literally what it tries to do, with only very minor constructive criticism. I'm very wary that these books are not great, by any stretch of the imagination. I had, however, been quite moved at certain times so I wondered whether this would transpose to the target reader, rather than me as the initial reader with my bliners on trying to bring the story to a conclusion and keep it on track.</p>
  <p>I'd liken this writing exerience to the running of the bulls through traditional Spanish villages. It's deplorable from the outset. It deserves the wrath of the general public for even thinking it's a good idea. But for the matador it's exhilerating. There's no script, no plan, it's entirely reactive. Nothing matters more than the matadors reaction because it's the only thing that shapes what comes back. The prompts are sacred and I realised, perhaps too late, that the more you try to add flourish or distraction, the worse the behaviour of ChatGPT, which is ever bullish in it's execution. It would have been helpful for me to have kept brainstorming to separate threads. The matador does not have time to think. It woudld certainly have been helpful for me not to have told ChatGPT that it had lost the plot. Don't insult the bull for the bull will kick out at you.<p>
  <p>Now, there are three books. I did work out that there would need to be 36 books in total to close off all the storylines I'd opened. I'm not sure we'll ever get to that point, the third book took a lot out of me. I'd love to get back into this story universe, for the love of the ride as much as anything else. But I'm not sure I will in the very near future.</p>

  <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
  <p>I would like to acknowledge the developers of LLM technologies. They've opened the floodgates on this type of project. I'm confident that restrictions and paywalls will start to become more rigid and I'm not sure how long a Choose your Own Adventure style experience will be available without subscription. Enjoy it while it lasts but don't depend on it for your future</p>
  <p>I'd like to extend my apologies to Marston's. The use of their company name in the thrid book was entirely unavoidable. It would have been a tragedy to spoil the story by replacing their name with something made up. It is absolutely clear where truth ends in the story and where artistic license and creativity begins. I don't want to spoil the story by pointing out the obvious but I do use the words "This is the inventive bit" in the story to deliniate what might have happened from the part I made up entirely in my head.I do not intend to make a single penny of money from any of these books. If I accidentally do then I shall make a sizabe donation to Marton's in the hope that they invest it in the town of Wolverhampton, preferably on keeping Banks's Mild Ale brewing in the town, now there's an idea.</p>
  <p>Finally to my family, my wife and my children. I love you all.</p>
