  <h2>The Seed</h2>
  <p>When I sat down on a warm summer's evening I had no idea that it would lead to a trilogy of stories being created. The true seed for the project was a set of photos I had seen of a day out at Arley Arboretum in Shropshire. As the crow flies it's close to me but by road a lot further away. God or erosion has chosen to put the River Severn in the way. I found out online that the arboretum has a Cedar of Lebanon, a tree held in high regard in Middle Eastern cultures and one that inspires many stories.</p>
  <p>I've been a member of a writing club for some time and typically gravitate towards writing poems as I am always confident I can finish them. A novel I'd started writing had been set to one side for a number of months. Reading about the tree had got me thinking though, and I thought how it would make a good backdrop to a Thomas Hardy style novel where the places matter as much to the story as the characters.</p>

</div>

<div class="w3-padding w3-white w3-display-container">

  <h2>The Seedling</h2>
  <p>With a desire to write like Thomas Hardy and not really knowing where to start, there was only one logical place to go. ChatGPT.</p>

    <div class="w3-container w3-center">
      <img class="w3-image w3-border w3-border-light-grey" src="img/chatgpt-prompt1.png" alt="Beneath"  style="width:50%;"/>
    </div>
  <p>The first book, Beneath the Cedars of Lebanon, was written over the course of an evening and a few hours the next day. 21 chapters. Generated via prompts, copied, pasted to Google Docs on my Poco X3 Pro phone, edited to correct issues with the story, narrative, continuity and character names before moving onto the next chapter. I removed the unnecessary commentary that often accompanied the generated text. The American spellings were resolved. The story took shape very quickly. Most of the story came to me as we went along, and it was my prompts that laid out what would happen in each chapter. Occasionally I paused to ask ChatGPT for some ideas, quite often I ignored them, sometimes I took them on. Occasionally I gave ChatGPT creative license explicitly. Mostly I asked ChatGPT to add filler in the style we'd set out because chapters tended to come out at around 600 words. The first book was written in next to no time at all.</p>

</div>

<div class="w3-padding w3-white w3-display-container">

  <h2>Primary Growth</h2>
  <p>Once the book was complete the whole thing went through a number of edits to try to make it read a little better. Repetition between chapters was a huge issue. Another issue was overall continuity. Late in the book I'd found a couple of hooks to bring the story to what I felt was a nice conclusion. A few of the hooks I chose were contradicted somewhat by sections earlier in the book so those had to be rewritten almost entirely. Without subscription there are limitations on how much you can use the latest ChatGPT model and older models produce varying results, often writing at a noticeably poorer standard. It was occasionally necessary to wait a few hours to let ChatGPT cool off and allow me back onto the latest model.</p>
  <p>As soon as I was reasonably happy I generated my first EPUB version of the book. I found it quite difficult to achieve this from a Google Doc on the phone. After experimenting I've found the easiest way is to download as an EPUB from Google Docs on the laptop and then use the excellent Calibre software to add the metadata and cover. The first draft of the first book was complete and I gave it to my daughter to read after emailing it to my Kindle, she didn't read it. I then gave it to my wife to read, she didn't because she was halfway through a Jessica Redland novel which she was far more interested in.</p>

<div class="w3-padding w3-white w3-display-container">

  <h2>Forestry</h2>
  <p>I was in the zone and determined to write a sequel, so I did. On the same ChatGPT thread, in fact. I did try to do it on a separate thread but it was almost impossible to summarise the characters and the story as well as the style. At least on the main thread ChatGPT had half a chance of remembering what we'd done so far. The second book was written over a couple of evenings and the third took a little longer, say around 8 to 10 hours in total to write.</p>
  <p>I'll admit to pausing between the first and second book to ask ChatGPT to review it as if it were a reviewer for The New York Times. The issue with doing this is that ChatGPT is designed to please you and often provides only minor constructive criticism. I'm very wary that these books are not a great read, by any stretch of the imagination. I had, however, been quite moved at certain points in the story so I wondered whether this would transpose to the target audience and was looking for an independent review.</p>
  <p>I'd liken the writing experience with ChatGPT to the running of the bulls through traditional Spanish villages. It's a deplorable activity from the outset. It deserves the wrath of the reader for even thinking it's a good idea. But for the matador it's exhilarating. There's no script, no plan, it's entirely reactive. Nothing matters more than the matador's reaction because its the only thing that shapes how the bull behaves. The prompts are sacred and I realised, perhaps too late, that the more you try to add flourish or distraction, the worse the behaviour of ChatGPT, which is ever bullish in its execution. It would have been helpful for me to have kept brainstorming to separate threads. The matador does not have time to think. It would certainly have been helpful for me not to have told ChatGPT that it had lost the plot. Don't insult the bull for the bull will kick out at you.</p>
  <p>I did work out that there would need to be 36 books in total to close off all the storylines I'd opened. I'm not sure we'll ever get to that point, the third book took a lot out of me. I'd love to get back into this story universe, for the love of this particular bull run as much as anything else. But I'm not sure I will in the near future.</p>

  <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
  <p>I would like to acknowledge the developers of LLM technologies. They've opened the floodgates on this type of project. I'm confident that restrictions and paywalls will start to become more rigid and I'm not sure how long a Choose your Own Adventure style experience will be available without subscription. Enjoy it while it lasts, but don't depend on it for your future</p>

  <p>I'm grateful to my family for giving me space to do little projects like this from time to time. Love to you all.</p>
